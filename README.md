# dnd_riddle_bs
came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/fdwox2/secret_warforged_riddles/) on r/dndgreentext once, so i decided to "write an algorithm to find a word in the dictionary".

the word list i used can be found [here](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/).

both "conglomerative" and "protevangelion" are valid answers to the riddle.
